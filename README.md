# Adapt

[![image](https://github.com/VolmitSoftware/Adapt/raw/main/storepage/adapt-tc.png)](https://github.com/VolmitSoftware/Adapt/wiki/Why-did-you-click)

## Overview

_Adapt is a drag and drop solution for balanced passive abilities and skills that players can enjoy on a server._

### Description

Adapt Abilities are all accessible in the in-game GUI (Right-clicking any Bookshelf **_Face_**) providing a more user-friendly experience to a "skills" system. Most servers want to increase the quality of the "vanilla" experience. Most Skill based plugins are about powers, game breaking systems, and riddles with bugs. That's where Adapt comes in.  Lightweight on the server, and providing mere quality of life enhancements to a user's experience. Below is a **WIP** List of features (_and descriptions_) that ill fill when i can. But this should give you a good idea of the roadmap for this plugin! Keep in mine this all WIP, can change at any time, and all of these can be configured  / disabled!

The master branch is for the latest version of minecraft.

### Language and Localization

If you would like to help out in translating the contents of Adapt we would love to have you help translate! We take this on an Honor System, so please only if you are confident in the language submit a translation key. Furthermore all translation keys are here: [[Right here]](https://github.com/VolmitSoftware/Adapt/tree/main/src/main/resources) And to add one all you need to do is use the lang code (en_US for example) and translate all they heys. if [i, Myself](https://github.com/NextdoorPsycho) know the language in any capacity, ill do my best to translate it myself for every file that is there when a new Skill / ABility / Translatable Key. PLESE NOTE: LANGUAGE FILES WILL NOT WORK NOR WILL ADAPT IF YOU TRY TO LOAD A LANGUAGE FILE THAT FORS NOT HAVE ALL KEYS, AND ALL KEYS THAT MATCH THE en_US FILE. Ill preface updates that need lanuage updates with: "Language Update Needed" in the release / Comit logs / Tags

# Building

### _Consider supporting our development by buying Adapt on [spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/adapt-leveling-skills-and-abilities.103790/)! We work hard to make Adapt the best it can be for everyone._


Building Adapt is not as Straightforward as [Iris](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/iris-world-gen-custom-biome-colors.84586/), though you will need to setup a few things if your system has never been used for java development.

<details>

<summary> Build Steps </summary>

### So this is fairly similar to Iris, but a bit modified.

### IDE Builds (for development & Compilation)

You NEED TO BE USING Intelij To build this project, or anything that can support the plugin [Manifold](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10057-manifold)

## Preface: if you need help compiling ask for support in the [discord](https://discord.gg/volmit), we give help regardless if you want to donate to us on spigot or compile it here :) we just want to be sure that you are able to use and enjoy the software regardless of circumstance.

1. Install [Java JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)
2. Set the JDK installation path to `JAVA_HOME` as an environment variable.
    * Windows
        1. Start > Type `env` and press Enter
        2. Advanced > Environment Variables
        3. Under System Variables, click `New...`
        4. Variable Name: `JAVA_HOME`
        5. Variable Value: `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17.0.1` (verify this exists after installing java don't just copy
           the example text)
    * MacOS
        1. Run `/usr/libexec/java_home -V` and look for Java 17
        2. Run `sudo nano ~/.zshenv`
        3. Add `export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)` as a new line
        4. Use `CTRL + X`, then Press `Y`, Then `ENTER`
        5. Quit & Reopen Terminal and verify with `echo $JAVA_HOME`. It should print a directory

3. Setup Gradle
<details>
<summary> Gradle Setup </summary>

   * Run `gradlew setup` any time you get dependency issues with craftbukkit
   * Configure ITJ Gradle to use JDK 17 (in settings, search for gradle)
   * Resync the project & run your newly created task (under the development folder in gradle tasks!)
   
</details>
  
4. INSTALL [MANIFOLD](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10057-manifold)
5. If this is your first time building Adapt for MC 1.19+ run `gradlew setup` inside the root Adapt project folder. Otherwise, skip this step. Grab a coffee, this may take up to 5 minutes depending on your cpu & internet connection.
6. Once the project has setup, run `gradlew adapt`
7. The Adapt jar will be placed in `Adapt/build/Adapt-XXX-XXX.jar` Enjoy! Consider supporting us by buying it on spigot!
